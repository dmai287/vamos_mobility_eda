# VAMOS Mobility App EDA
This repository hosts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on understanding user behavior, mobility patterns, and key metrics within the VAMOS Mobility App. VAMOS is a transportation and mobility app aimed at improving urban travel by offering real-time data on public transit, carpooling, cycling, and other transportation options.

## Project Objectives
The primary goal of this EDA is to leverage data-driven insights to:

- Analyze and interpret user engagement trends.
- Identify popular transportation modes and their usage patterns.
- Understand peak usage times, geographic hotspots, and common mobility routes.
- Highlight potential areas for app improvement and user experience optimization.

## Dataset Overview
The data used in this project includes:

- User activity logs: Contains information on app interactions, session durations, and feature usage.
- Geolocation data: Provides insights into frequently traveled routes, stop locations, and transit times.
- Mode-specific metrics: Includes public transit, cycling, carpooling, and walking data to analyze modal preferences.

## Notebooks and Structure
This repository is organized as follows:

- Data Cleaning and Preparation: Includes scripts and notebooks for data preprocessing and wrangling.
- Exploratory Analysis: Detailed EDA notebooks to visualize trends and patterns in the data.
- Key Insights and Visualizations: Summarizes main findings through visualizations and actionable insights.

## Key Findings
Through this analysis, the project uncovers:

- Usage trends by time, day, and location.
- Mode-specific adoption rates, revealing popular transport modes.
- User engagement patterns, including retention metrics and session durations.

## Requirements
The project is developed in Python, using libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. Specific installation instructions and dependencies can be found in the requirements.txt file.
